# Software Design Project - Internship Application System

This software design project involves the successful implementation of Software Design concepts, such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Class Diagrams, to create an Internship Application System. The system provides a seamless and efficient application process for new interns to apply, track their applications, and explore additional programs posted by the organization.

## Project Highlights

- **Software Design Implementation:**
  - Successfully implemented Software Design concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming and Class Diagrams, to accurately illustrate system functionalities and interactions.

- **Use Case Diagrams:**
  - Developed detailed use case diagrams to capture the system's functionality from the user's perspective, ensuring a clear understanding of the application's purpose.

- **Class Diagrams:**
  - Created class diagrams to represent the system's structure, highlighting classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. This ensured a well-structured and organized system design.

- **Sequence Diagrams:**
  - Designed sequence diagrams to illustrate the flow of control in the system, ensuring a clear understanding of the interactions between the system's components.

- **Design Patterns Integration:**
  - Successfully integrated design patterns, including Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns, to enhance system architecture. This ensures scalability and maintainability of the Internship Application System.
